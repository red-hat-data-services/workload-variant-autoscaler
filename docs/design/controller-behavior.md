# Controller Event Handling and Reconciliation Behavior

## Overview

The WVA controller uses Kubernetes controller-runtime to watch and respond to various resource events in the cluster. This document describes how the controller handles different types of events and triggers reconciliation.

## Event Filtering Philosophy

WVA employs a **selective event filtering** strategy to optimize controller performance and reduce unnecessary reconciliation cycles:

- **Allow events that require action**: Only events that necessitate immediate controller action trigger reconciliation
- **Block redundant events**: Events that don't change the controller's decision-making are filtered out
- **Periodic reconciliation handles drift**: The controller reconciles all VariantAutoscaling resources periodically (default: 60s), ensuring eventual consistency without relying on every individual event

## Watched Resources

### 1. VariantAutoscaling (Primary Resource)

**Events Handled:**
- **Create**: ✅ Triggers reconciliation to initialize the resource
- **Update**: ❌ Blocked - Periodic reconciliation handles all updates
- **Delete**: ❌ Blocked - Periodic reconciliation detects deleted resources
- **Generic**: ❌ Blocked

**Rationale:**
The controller reconciles all VariantAutoscaling resources on a periodic interval (60s by default). Individual Update and Delete events would only cause unnecessary reconciliation cycles since:
- Updates are handled in the next periodic reconciliation
- Deleted resources are filtered out in `filterActiveVariantAutoscalings()`

### 2. Deployment

**Events Handled:**
- **Create**: ✅ Triggers reconciliation for VAs referencing this deployment
- **Update**: ❌ Blocked
- **Delete**: ✅ Triggers reconciliation for VAs referencing this deployment
- **Generic**: ❌ Blocked

**Create Event - Race Condition Handling:**

Deployment Create events handle a critical race condition:

```
Timeline:
T0: User creates VariantAutoscaling CR for deployment "llama-8b"
T1: VA reconciliation runs - deployment doesn't exist yet
T2: User creates Deployment "llama-8b"
T3: ??? Without Create event handling, VA waits until next periodic cycle
```

When a Deployment is created:
1. Controller lists all VAs in the same namespace
2. Finds VAs with matching `scaleTargetRef` or inferred target name
3. Triggers immediate reconciliation of those VAs

This ensures VAs become operational immediately when their target deployment appears, rather than waiting up to 60 seconds for the next periodic reconciliation.

**Delete Event - Status Update and Cleanup:**

Deployment Delete events allow the VA to respond immediately when its target deployment is removed:

```yaml
# Before deployment deletion
status:
  conditions:
  - type: Ready
    status: "True"
  desiredOptimizedAlloc:
    numReplicas: 3
    accelerator: "A100"

# After deployment deletion (immediate update)
status:
  conditions:
  - type: Ready
    status: "False"
    reason: "DeploymentNotFound"
    message: "Target deployment no longer exists"
  desiredOptimizedAlloc: {}
```

When a Deployment is deleted:
1. Controller identifies all VAs referencing the deleted deployment
2. Triggers reconciliation for those VAs
3. VA status is updated to reflect the missing deployment
4. Associated metrics are cleared or updated
5. VA is marked as not ready until deployment is recreated

This provides immediate visibility into the deployment's absence and prevents stale metrics from affecting autoscaling decisions.

**Implementation:**

```go
// DeploymentPredicate returns a predicate that filters Deployment events.
// It allows Create and Delete events for all Deployments to trigger VA reconciliation:
// - Create: handles the race condition where VA is created before its target deployment
// - Delete: allows VA to update status and clear metrics when target deployment is removed
func DeploymentPredicate() predicate.Predicate {
	return predicate.Funcs{
		CreateFunc: func(e event.CreateEvent) bool {
			return true  // Allow all Deployment create events
		},
		UpdateFunc: func(e event.UpdateEvent) bool {
			return false  // Block Deployment update events
		},
		DeleteFunc: func(e event.DeleteEvent) bool {
			return true  // Allow all Deployment delete events
		},
		GenericFunc: func(e event.GenericEvent) bool {
			return false  // Block generic events
		},
	}
}
```

### 3. ConfigMap

**Events Handled:**
- **Create**: ✅ Processed by event handler
- **Update**: ✅ Processed by event handler (required for config changes)
- **Delete**: ❌ Blocked
- **Generic**: ❌ Blocked

**Watched ConfigMaps:**
- `wva-manager-config` (default name)
  - Contains global optimization configuration (e.g., `GLOBAL_OPT_INTERVAL`)
- `wva-saturation-scaling-config` (default name)
  - Contains per-accelerator saturation scaling thresholds

**Rationale:**
ConfigMap updates need to be processed immediately to apply new configuration. However, ConfigMap changes update the global configuration cache and don't trigger individual VA reconciliation - the Engine loop reads the updated configuration on its next cycle.

**Predicate:**

```go
// ConfigMapPredicate returns a predicate that filters ConfigMap events to only the target ConfigMaps.
// It accepts a namespaceChecker function to filter ConfigMaps in tracked namespaces (prevents cluster-wide watching).
func ConfigMapPredicate(namespaceChecker func(string) bool) predicate.Predicate {
	return predicate.NewPredicateFuncs(func(obj client.Object) bool {
		name := obj.GetName()
		namespace := obj.GetNamespace()
		// Well-known ConfigMap names in controller namespace (global) or tracked namespaces (namespace-local)
		return (name == getConfigMapName() || name == getSaturationConfigMapName()) && 
		       obj.GetNamespace() == configMapNamespace
	})
}
```

### 4. ServiceMonitor

**Events Handled:**
- **Create**: ✅ Processed (no reconciliation triggered)
- **Update**: ✅ When `deletionTimestamp` is set (finalizers cause deletion to emit Update events)
- **Delete**: ✅ Processed (no reconciliation triggered)
- **Generic**: ❌ Blocked

**Purpose:**
The controller watches its own ServiceMonitor (`wva-controller-manager-metrics-monitor`) for observability purposes. When the ServiceMonitor is deleted:

1. Prometheus stops scraping controller metrics
2. External autoscalers (HPA/KEDA) can't access optimized replica metrics
3. Controller logs warnings and emits Kubernetes events to alert operators

**Important:** ServiceMonitor events do NOT trigger VA reconciliation. The ServiceMonitor affects metrics scraping, not optimization logic. The handler exists solely for observability.

**Predicate:**

```go
// ServiceMonitorPredicate returns a predicate that filters ServiceMonitor events to only the target ServiceMonitor.
func ServiceMonitorPredicate() predicate.Predicate {
	return predicate.NewPredicateFuncs(func(obj client.Object) bool {
		return obj.GetName() == defaultServiceMonitorName && 
		       obj.GetNamespace() == configMapNamespace
	})
}
```

## Periodic Reconciliation

In addition to event-driven reconciliation, the controller performs **periodic reconciliation** of all VariantAutoscaling resources:

- **Default Interval**: 60 seconds
- **Configurable**: Via `GLOBAL_OPT_INTERVAL` in ConfigMap
- **Purpose**: Ensures eventual consistency and handles:
  - Metric collection and analysis
  - Optimization decisions
  - Status updates
  - Detection of deleted resources

This periodic reconciliation is why many Update and Delete events can be safely filtered - the controller will process changes in the next cycle.

## Event Flow Examples

### Example 1: Deployment Created Before VA

```
1. User creates Deployment "llama-8b"
   → No VA exists yet, no action taken

2. User creates VariantAutoscaling "llama-8b-autoscaler"
   → Create event triggers reconciliation
   → Controller finds deployment, begins monitoring
```

### Example 2: VA Created Before Deployment (Race Condition)

```
1. User creates VariantAutoscaling "llama-8b-autoscaler"
   → Create event triggers reconciliation
   → Deployment doesn't exist, VA status reflects this

2. User creates Deployment "llama-8b"
   → Deployment Create event triggers VA reconciliation
   → Controller finds matching VA, updates status
   → VA becomes operational immediately (no 60s wait)
```

### Example 3: Deployment Deleted

```
1. Deployment "llama-8b" is running with VA "llama-8b-autoscaler"
   → VA status shows Ready=True, 3 replicas

2. User deletes Deployment "llama-8b"
   → Deployment Delete event triggers VA reconciliation
   → Controller updates VA status: Ready=False, DeploymentNotFound
   → Metrics are cleared
   → Operators are immediately aware of the issue

3. User recreates Deployment "llama-8b"
   → Deployment Create event triggers VA reconciliation
   → VA becomes operational again
```

### Example 4: ConfigMap Updated

```
1. Admin updates wva-saturation-scaling-config ConfigMap
   → Update event processed by ConfigMap handler
   → Global configuration cache updated
   → Engine loop reads new config on next cycle
   → No individual VA reconciliation triggered
```

## Prerequisites

### `llm-d.ai/variant` Label on the Scale Target

**Required only for shadow-pod layouts.** For ordinary `Deployment` and `LeaderWorkerSet` scale targets, WVA's `PodLocator` (under `internal/collector/locator/`) derives the pod → variant association by walking `ownerReferences` from the vLLM pod up to the managed scaler's `scaleTargetRef`. No operator action is required at the metrics layer for those layouts.

For *shadow-pod* layouts — where the vLLM pod is **not** in the HPA-scaled target's `ownerReferences` chain — the label is the only viable linkage. Two things must be true in that case:

1. The `llm-d.ai/variant` label must be present on the **pod template** of the vLLM-bearing workload, with a value equal to the name of the managed `HorizontalPodAutoscaler` or KEDA `ScaledObject` (which is also the synthetic `VariantAutoscaling` name).
2. The `ServiceMonitor` or `PodMonitor` that Prometheus uses to scrape those pods must include a target relabeling rule that propagates the pod label into the scraped metrics as `llm_d_ai_variant`.

**Both are your responsibility.** WVA does not configure either automatically.

For non-shadow-pod layouts, stamping the label is harmless — the label-driven fast path simply short-circuits the locator. Operators may keep it for backwards compatibility or remove it.

#### 1. Set the pod template label (shadow-pod layouts)

```yaml
# Deployment example — required for shadow-pod layouts; optional otherwise.
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: llama-8b
  namespace: llm-d
spec:
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        llm-d.ai/variant: llama-8b-autoscaler   # must match the VariantAutoscaling name
    spec:
      containers: [...]
```

```yaml
# LeaderWorkerSet example — required for shadow-pod layouts; optional otherwise.
apiVersion: leaderworkerset.x-k8s.io/v1
kind: LeaderWorkerSet
metadata:
  name: llama-70b
  namespace: llm-d
spec:
  leaderWorkerTemplate:
    leaderTemplate:
      metadata:
        labels:
          llm-d.ai/variant: llama-70b-autoscaler   # must match the VariantAutoscaling name
    workerTemplate:
      metadata:
        labels:
          llm-d.ai/variant: llama-70b-autoscaler   # must match the VariantAutoscaling name
```

#### 2. Patch the ServiceMonitor or PodMonitor to propagate the label

The `llm-d.ai/variant` pod label must flow through Prometheus target relabeling into the scraped metric series as `llm_d_ai_variant`. Add the following relabeling rule to the `endpoints[].relabelings` section of your `ServiceMonitor`, or to the `podMetricsEndpoints[].relabelings` section of your `PodMonitor`:

```yaml
# ServiceMonitor patch
spec:
  endpoints:
  - relabelings:
    - sourceLabels: [__meta_kubernetes_pod_label_llm_d_ai_variant]
      targetLabel: llm_d_ai_variant
      action: replace
```

```yaml
# PodMonitor patch
spec:
  podMetricsEndpoints:
  - relabelings:
    - sourceLabels: [__meta_kubernetes_pod_label_llm_d_ai_variant]
      targetLabel: llm_d_ai_variant
      action: replace
```

> **Important**: This rule must live under `relabelings` (target relabeling), **not** `metricRelabelings` (metric relabeling). The `__meta_kubernetes_pod_label_*` labels are only available during target relabeling and are stripped before metric relabeling runs.

WVA uses the `llm_d_ai_variant` metric label to associate per-pod metrics with the correct `VariantAutoscaling` resource.

If the pod label or the relabeling rule is absent, WVA will not be able to associate metrics with a variant **for shadow-pod layouts**. For ordinary Deployment / LWS layouts the locator will resolve the variant via `ownerReferences` and metric association continues to work without the label.

## Best Practices

### For Operators

1. **For shadow-pod layouts, set `llm-d.ai/variant` before creating the VA**: For shadow-pod workloads (vLLM pods not in the scaler's `ownerReferences` chain), ensure the pod template label is present before creating the `VariantAutoscaling` resource. WVA begins collecting metrics on the first reconciliation and, in those layouts, will miss pods that don't yet carry the label. For ordinary Deployment / LWS scale targets the label is optional — the locator resolves variants via `ownerReferences`.

2. **Create VAs after deployments are ready**: While the controller handles the race condition, creating VAs after deployments are fully initialized avoids unnecessary early reconciliation cycles.

3. **Monitor ServiceMonitor health**: If the controller's ServiceMonitor is deleted, external autoscalers can't access metrics. Watch for `ServiceMonitorDeleted` events.

4. **Understand reconciliation timing**: 
   - Critical events (Deployment create/delete) trigger immediate reconciliation
   - Other changes are handled in the next periodic cycle (≤60s)

### For Developers

1. **Add predicates for new watches**: Always implement a predicate when watching new resource types to avoid unnecessary reconciliation.

2. **Consider periodic reconciliation**: Before handling an event type, ask: "Does this need immediate action, or will the next periodic reconciliation handle it?"

3. **Document event handling decisions**: Explain why specific events are allowed or blocked in code comments.

## Troubleshooting

### VA Not Responding to Deployment

**Symptom**: VA exists but doesn't process new deployment

**Diagnosis**:
```bash
# Check if deployment name matches VA's target
kubectl get va llama-8b-autoscaler -o jsonpath='{.spec.scaleTargetRef.name}'
kubectl get deployment llama-8b

# Check controller logs for deployment events
kubectl logs -n workload-variant-autoscaler-system deployment/controller-manager | grep "Deployment created"
```

**Solution**: Ensure VA's `scaleTargetRef` or inferred target matches the deployment name.

### Scaling Decisions Not Made for a Variant

**Symptom**: WVA is running and the VA exists, but no scaling decisions are produced for a specific variant (e.g., `wva_desired_replicas` has no series for that variant).

**Likely causes**:
- The `llm-d.ai/variant` pod label is missing or has the wrong value on the scale target's pod template.
- The ServiceMonitor or PodMonitor that scrapes those pods is missing the relabeling rule that propagates `llm-d.ai/variant` → `llm_d_ai_variant`.

**Diagnosis**:
```bash
# Verify the label is present on live pods
kubectl get pods -n <namespace> -l llm-d.ai/variant=<va-name>

# Check the pod template label on the Deployment
kubectl get deployment <name> -n <namespace> \
  -o jsonpath='{.spec.template.metadata.labels.llm-d\.ai/variant}'

# Check the pod template labels on a LeaderWorkerSet
kubectl get lws <name> -n <namespace> \
  -o jsonpath='{.spec.leaderWorkerTemplate.workerTemplate.metadata.labels.llm-d\.ai/variant}'

# Confirm the label flows through to Prometheus metrics
# (replace <va-name> with the VariantAutoscaling resource name)
curl -G 'http://<prometheus>/api/v1/query' \
  --data-urlencode 'query=vllm:num_requests_running{llm_d_ai_variant="<va-name>"}'

# If the query returns no results, check the ServiceMonitor for the relabeling rule
kubectl get servicemonitor <name> -n <monitoring-namespace> -o yaml | grep -A5 relabeling
```

**Solution 1 — missing pod label**: Add the label to the pod template and roll out the workload.

```bash
kubectl patch deployment <name> -n <namespace> \
  --type=merge \
  -p '{"spec":{"template":{"metadata":{"labels":{"llm-d.ai/variant":"<va-name>"}}}}}'
```

**Solution 2 — missing relabeling rule**: Patch the ServiceMonitor (or PodMonitor) to add the rule that propagates the pod label into Prometheus metrics.

```bash
# For a ServiceMonitor — patch the first endpoint's relabelings
kubectl patch servicemonitor <name> -n <monitoring-namespace> \
  --type=json \
  -p '[{"op":"add","path":"/spec/endpoints/0/relabelings/-","value":{"sourceLabels":["__meta_kubernetes_pod_label_llm_d_ai_variant"],"targetLabel":"llm_d_ai_variant","action":"replace"}}]'

# For a PodMonitor — patch the first podMetricsEndpoint's relabelings
kubectl patch podmonitor <name> -n <monitoring-namespace> \
  --type=json \
  -p '[{"op":"add","path":"/spec/podMetricsEndpoints/0/relabelings/-","value":{"sourceLabels":["__meta_kubernetes_pod_label_llm_d_ai_variant"],"targetLabel":"llm_d_ai_variant","action":"replace"}}]'
```

### Metrics Not Available

**Symptom**: External autoscaler can't read `wva_optimized_replicas` metric

**Diagnosis**:
```bash
# Check if ServiceMonitor exists
kubectl get servicemonitor -n workload-variant-autoscaler-system wva-controller-manager-metrics-monitor

# Check controller events
kubectl get events -n workload-variant-autoscaler-system --field-selector involvedObject.kind=ServiceMonitor
```

**Solution**: Recreate the ServiceMonitor if it was deleted.
